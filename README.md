## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- First time building multiple page using React and its React Routes specialty. Building this few pages took me alot more time then I thought to add in all the animation I wanted to.
- Also first time splitting so pages into different component with its own css. Not sure is it normal to have 200 line + css per component or not...

### Continued development

- Animation with React 
- Multiple page with React
